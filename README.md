# Louise Kickstarter Analysis

## Project Overview
The goal of this analysis was to uncover any trends over the course of an eight-year data collection of Louise Kickstarter campaign. The data collected covered a range of information that could feel overwhelming. We were able to breakdown the data in order to highlight trends that were hidden within the large amount of data. By breaking down the information we were able to highlight outcomes that were successful, failed, canceled or live. From there we could show how those outcomes could be affected based on launch date and their goals. 

## Analysis on Launch Date and Goal Success Rate
When looking at theater campaigns based on their launch date, we can see a higher success rate between May and July. If we look at Figure 1 (Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date) there is a large spike from the successful campaigns starting in May that drops in September. This information shows us that campaigns that are the most successful are launched in May. While we do not know why there is spike, we can assume it would be from the warmer weather. In Figure 1 there is a drastic dip when Launch dates start in November. If we look at failed campaigns there are no significant months where failed campaigns spike. If a campaign wants to be the most successful, one step will be to launch their campaign in May or to encourage campaigns during the warmer season.

Another angle we took is by compiling the campaign goals and separating them starting at less than $1,000 and increase them $4,999 at a time and finish at $50,000 or more. We can see at what price most campaigns succeeded and failed. Our line graph shown in Figure 2 (Outcomes Based on Goal) has the percentage of successful and failed goals on the y-axis and the monetary value on the x-axis. The most successful campaigns had a goal within $5,000. The graph can be miss leading though. There are outliers within the higher donations such as $35,000 to $44,999. While 67% are successful, we only have nine projects to analyze. Within the value of less than $1,000 to $4,999 we have a total of 720 projects. From this we can analyze that most projects will succeed within the value range of less than $1,000 to $4,999.

## Conclusion
In conclusion our analysis shows that Theater campaigns that have their launch date in May and continue through July, will have a greater success rate from their campaigns. Not only is the launch date a significant factor with success, so are the campaigns goals amount. Campaigns that set their goal within at less than $1,000 to $4,999, had a 73% success rate at meeting their goal.
