# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The goal of this analysis was to uncover any trends over the course of an eight-year data collection of Louise Kickstarter campaign. The data collected covered a range of information that could feel overwhelming. We were able to breakdown the data in order to highlight trends that were hidden within the large amount of data. By breaking down the information we were able to highlight outcomes that were successful, failed, canceled or live. From there we could show how those outcomes could be affected based on launch date and their goals. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to help Louise make sense of the data she has compiled over the course of eight years. Having such a large amount of data is helpful but becomes overwhelming when looking at all the data within one spreadsheet. By compiling the data and separating it, we can see trends that were otherwise hidden.  

## Analysis and Challenges
Two areas of focus that were taken on this analysis were Outcomes based on Launch Date and Outcomes Based on Goals. Two areas campaigns can control are when they begin and what amount they should aim for. In order to gather this data, our first step is to select the right data we want to compare. 

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date 
When looking at theater campaigns based on their launch date, we can see a higher success rate between May and July. If we look at Figure 1 (Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date) there is a large spike from the successful campaigns starting in May that drops in September. This information shows us that campaigns that are the most successful are launched in May. While we do not know why there is spike, we can assume it would be from the warmer weather. In Figure 1 there is a drastic dip when Launch dates start in November. If we look at failed campaigns there are no significant months where failed campaigns spike. If a campaign wants to be the most successful, one step will be to launch their campaign in May or to encourage campaigns during the warmer season.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Another angle we took is by compiling the campaign goals and separating them starting at less than $1,000 and increase them $4,999 at a time and finish at $50,000 or more. We can see at what price most campaigns succeeded and failed. Our line graph shown in Figure 2 (Outcomes Based on Goal) has the percentage of successful and failed goals on the y-axis and the monetary value on the x-axis. The most successful campaigns had a goal within $5,000. The graph can be miss leading though. There are outliers within the higher donations such as $35,000 to $44,999. While 67% are successful, we only have nine projects to analyze. Within the value of less than $1,000 to $4,999 we have a total of 720 projects. From this we can analyze that most projects will succeed within the value range of less than $1,000 to $4,999.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One area of difficulty within this analysis was within the Outcomes Based on Goals.  Typing each formula twelve times each for both successful and fail was very time consuming. Within the formula, the only reference point that would need to change are the goal amount and success and failed. In order to fix this issue, I locked the cell I wanted to reference “D” and “F” with a “$” sign in order to lock those reference points. Then I was able to drag and copy the formula. After that, the only reference points that needed to be altered was the goal amount. Instead of retyping the entire formula twenty-four times, only the goal amount and successful reference we have to be changed.  

## Results
-	In conclusion our analysis shows that Theater campaigns that have their launch date in May and continue through July, will have a greater success rate from their campaigns. While we can see a large spike with successful campaigns in May, there are no significant changes of failed launch dates.  
-	Not only is the launch date a significant factor with success, so are the campaigns goals amount. Campaigns that set their goal within at less than $1,000 to $4,999, had a 73% success rate. 
-	What are some limitation of this dataset?
-	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
